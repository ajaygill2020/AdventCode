# Programming Puzzle #2

Now that you know how AoC works. Let's keep going.

Now you'll solve the Day 2 puzzles (part 1 and part 2) from [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). This problem is pretty straight forward. Just read the instructions carefully - especially in Part 2.

For our class purposes, you need to do a few things:

1. You need to write the Python code to solve the puzzles. Your code should be **well commented** and convey your basic strategy for how you are solving the problem. In particular, discuss why you chose to use the data structures you did. 

You can do this in a Jupyter notebook if you'd like or use an IDE such as PyCharm or VSCode. 

2. After solving (or not) the puzzle, you will submit your Jupyter notebook or .py file via Moodle in this Assignment upload area.

3. After you solve the Day 2 puzzles, submit your answer in your AoC account and then take a screenshot of your AoC main page so I can see your gold stars. Upload your screenshot as a png or jpg file along with your notebook or .py file.
